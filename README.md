### About my project

My website features EV cars from Tesla.  There is a range of cars and I'm including here, the 'S' and 'Model 3' particularly.
The images are a mix of royalty free and stock images that I will declare later in this document as not owned by me.  I will also acknowledge these by way of URLs that indicate its source.

The user is shown a few examples of these cars to highlight the visual aspects and information about the specifications.
I enjoyed creating this and have added a second language option as a strong national feature.
